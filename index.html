            My name is Daniel Florek. I am a programmer/web developer from
            Košice, Slovakia. Not long time ago I had finished my Bachelor's
            degree at

              University of Technology in Brno

              SoftwareAG
            </a>

                    My first IT work experience. It was a summer student job. My
                    two prior tasks were writing simple assisting software
                    utilities for people in office and also software for
                    production hall. Software for people in the office was
                    primarily in VBA in Access/Excel or some small programs they
                    needed (files sorting based on contents etc). For production
                    hall I wrote several applications that were controlling
                    ZEBRA label printers. Main technologies I used during this
                    summer job were VBA, VB and C#.

                    First job after finishing of Bachelor's studies. I was
                    assigned to Aris Cloud Team. My first task was getting
                    SoftwareAG's online product Aris Cloud on the Amazon
                    Marketplace. So I and my colleague created a connector
                    between Amazon Marketplace and Aris Cloud that allowed to
                    create account on Aris Cloud after creating a contract on
                    Amazon Marketplace. As implementation technology we used
                    Spring Boot with plugin Thymeleaf. My second task was
                    re-writing one module of Aris Cloud from PHP into Angular
                    frontend with Java (Spring Boot) backend so it would be more
                    scalable and more future-proofed. I worked here for 8
                    months.

                  Aris Cloud was supposed to go on Amazon AWS Marketplace. So I
                  and my colleague created a connector between Aris Cloud and
                  AWS Marketplace where customer was redirected after his
                  contract was created on Marketplace. The connector provided a
                  registration form for creating an Aris Cloud account.

                  Aris Cloud's login and administration module was written in
                  PHP as temporary solution. So we reworked these modules to
                  Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend so it is
                  future-proofed and easily scalable.

                  either from online stream or hardware device and output this
                  live source to external video output. It could also substitute
                  live input for local media (video/picture) for advertisement
                  purposes. Application could also record this live input and
                  create highlights from it. These highlights could also be
                  played on external video output device. Application is
                  supposed to be used on sport stadiums for operating big
